Hard RimWorld Optimization (HRWO) is a lightweight performance mod focused on reducing TPS load in large and long-running colonies.

The goal is simple: keep the game responsive without changing core gameplay balance. All features are configurable and can be enabled or disabled individually.

Features:

• Wildlife Optimization  
  Throttles factionless neutral animals to significantly reduce idle AI load. Optional exclusions for predators and animals near colonists.

• Turret Optimization  
  Reduces unnecessary target scans when no threats are present, improving performance in heavily fortified bases.

• Prisoner Optimization  
  Throttles idle prisoners to reduce AI overhead in prison-heavy colonies while keeping interactions responsive.

• Quest Optimization  
  Optimizes natural quest selection and normalizes invalid point calls (points ≤ 0) to prevent stutters and scaling issues.  
  Includes safe fallback logic to preserve vanilla behavior.

• Faction UI Improvement  
  Compacts hostile faction icons in the Factions tab for cleaner layout and minor UI performance benefits.

This mod is designed to be safe, modular, and compatible with most gameplay mods.  
However, as with any optimization mod, use at your own discretion and test in your mod list.

Good luck, and enjoy smoother colonies.
